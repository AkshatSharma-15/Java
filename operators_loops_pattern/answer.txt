1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans: They aJe used when a condition compJises moJe than one boolean expJession. FoJ instance/ if we want to
pJint a numbeJ only if it is gJeateJ than 2 and less than 5/ then we will use conditional opeJatoJs to combine the
2 expJessions. We have 3 types of conditional opeJatoJs - logical-and/ logical-oJ and teJnaJy opeJatoJ.

Logical-and operator (&&)
It is used when we want the condition to be tJue iff both the expJessions aJe tJue.

Logical-or operator (||)
This opeJatoJ is used when we aJe satisfied as long as any one of the boolean expJessions is evaluated as tJue.

Ternary operator (?:)
It is a smalleJ veJsion foJ the if-else statement. If the condition is tJue then the statement - 1 is executed else the
statement - 2 is executed.

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans: There are thJee types of opeJatoJs in java based on the numbeJ of opeJands. They aJe
. Unary opeJator
. Binary opeJator
. Ternary opeJator
.
3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
Ans: Switch statement
The switch case in java is used to select one of many code blocks foJ execution.
Break keyword: As java Jeaches a bJeak keywoJd/ the contJol bJeaks out of the switch block. The execution of
code stops on encounteJing this keywoJd/ and the case testing inside the block ends as the match is found. A
lot of execution time can be saved because it ignoJes the Jest of the code's execution when theJe is a bJeak.
Default keywoJd The keywoJd is used to specify the code executed when the expJession does not match any
test case.
The switch case in Java woJks like an if-else laddeJ/ i.e./ multiple conditions can be checked at once. Switch is
pJovided with an expJession that can be a constant oJ liteJal expJession that can be evaluated. The value of the
expJession is matched with each test case till a match is found. If theJe is no match/ the default keywoJd/ if
specified- the associated code executes. OtheJwise/ the code specified foJ the matched test case is executed.

4. What are the priority levels of arithmeti6 operation in <ava3
Ans: High priority * / %
     Low priority + -

6. What is syntax of if else.
Ans: if(condition1)
     {

     }
     else if(condition2)
     {

     }
     else
     {

     }

7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java.
Ans: for loop , while loop , do-while loop.

8. Write a program to print 1 to 10 no.
--> public class abc{
     public static void main(String args[])
     {
          for(int i = 1 ; i <= 10 ; i++)
          {
               System.out.println(i);
          }
     }
}
